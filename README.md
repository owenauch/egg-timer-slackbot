# Egg Timer Slack Bot

Egg Timer is a simple timer Slack Bot to be used as an alarm for short-term events. Egg Timer has one slash command, `/timer [number of seconds]`, which takes in a number of seconds to set as the length of timer, and will print `[number of seconds] is up!` after that number of seconds has passed. This bot was created out of a need for a Slack bot that could set timer intervals shorter than full minute intervals, and was written using [Stdlib's Slack Template](https://github.com/stdlib/utils.templates/tree/master/templates/slack/_files). It is not currently available publicly, but could be made public upon request.
